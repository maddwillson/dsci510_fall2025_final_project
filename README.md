I used a NYT Developer API key for an app to search article data. I set it in an .env file that looks simular to the .env.example file. Please add your API key there to run on your own.

I have used quite a few special python packages. First is yfinance which allows me to pull stock data from Yahoo Finance based on a ticker. Then we have os and dotenvn which allowed me to get my API key accessible. I used pandas to help manage my data in a DataFrame. I used datetime and time to help communcate differnt dates. Finally, I used json to help save my article data.
